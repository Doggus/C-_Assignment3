To run the file, the following command is used: ./huffancode input output

To compile the Unit Test file: make test
To run the Unit Test file: make runTest

no extensions (.txt, .hdr, etc) are neccesary for input or ouput. My code handles it automatically (DONT PUT THEM IN THE COMMAND LINE)

A '#' has been used to represent nodes in the huffman tree that don't have a letter. 

Copy and Move constructors cause my program to behave weridly, so I have commented them out. They are there to be looked at if neccesary. This also prevented me from writing Unit tests for them.

Methods in declared in the driver file couldn't be tested because the process to be able to test those files is confusing and casued issues.

Nothing else of note to mention. Have a good day :)
